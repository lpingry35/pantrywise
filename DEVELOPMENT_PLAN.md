2. Create tutorialSteps.js with all tour content
3. Add tutorial state management to App.jsx
4. Check localStorage for first-time visitors
5. Trigger tutorial for new users and guest accounts
6. Add "Restart Tutorial" button in navigation or settings
7. Style to match PantryWise theme (blue/purple gradient)
8. Test on mobile and desktop
9. Ensure all steps are skippable

**User Triggers:**
- First-time visitor (hasSeenTutorial = false in localStorage)

- ‚úÖ Easier for other developers to understand

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create new component files (6 total)
2. Extract logic from MealPlanner.jsx
3. Move state management to appropriate levels
4. Ensure props are passed correctly
5. Test all functionality still works
6. Delete redundant code from original file
7. Update imports in parent components

**When to Do This:**
