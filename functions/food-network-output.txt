    "description": "Pasta, milk and cheese all cooked in a single pot may be mac and cheese at its most basic, but this streamlined 3-ingredient version doesn’t skimp on the creamy richness you expect from homemade — and it’s as quick to cook as packaged versions. We experimented with different combinations of dairy to land on our simple formula. For the creamiest results, we like the combination of evaporated milk and American cheese, but you can tweak the recipe by using half-and-half or whole milk if you prefer. Similarly, American cheese gave the dish the creamiest finish, but if you want to vary the flavor you can use half American cheese and half of another good melting cheese — mild Cheddar, Monterey Jack or pepper jack, Colby, Havarti or fontina are all excellent.",
