  - User enters what they actually bought
  - Handle quantity additions for existing items
  - *Note*: ShoppingListPage.jsx now 800+ lines (TD-009)

### üöß In Progress:
- **7.5 Pantry Lifecycle Management** (Added Oct 20, 2025)
  
  **7.5.1b Common Package Suggestions** (Future Enhancement)
  - Show common retail package sizes (8 oz bag, 1 lb box, etc.)
  - Quick-select buttons for standard quantities
  - Learn from user patterns over time
  
  **7.5.1c Retail Intelligence** (Long-term)
  - Integrate with grocery store APIs
  - Show actual products and prices
  - Auto-suggest based on local store inventory
  
  **7.5.2 Recipe Completion Tracking** (Starting Now)
  - Mark recipes as "cooked/completed" from meal planner
  - Deduct used ingredients from pantry
  - Track cooking history
  - Handle partial quantities
  - Prevent negative pantry quantities
  
  **Questions to Consider When Implementing 7.5.2:**
  - Where should "Mark as Cooked" button live? (meal planner calendar, recipe cards, or both?)
  - How to handle partial recipe cooking? (if someone makes half a recipe)
  - Should we track cooking history? (show "You made this 3 times", help with suggestions)
  - How to handle insufficient pantry quantities? (warning with override option?)
  
  **7.5.3 Manual Pantry Editing** (NEW - Oct 20, 2025)
  - **Issue**: Users cook things outside of meal plans (leftovers, snacks, non-recipe meals)
  - **Solution**: Make every pantry item quantity editable
  - Features needed:
    - Edit quantity for any pantry item (increase or decrease)
    - Quick subtract buttons (-1 cup, -1/2 cup, etc.)
    - Delete individual items
    - Manual add items not from shopping
    - "Used for other cooking" quick deduction
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Made sandwiches (deduct bread, lunch meat)
    - Used ingredients for non-planned meals
    - Gave some ingredients to neighbor
    - Some food went bad
    - Manual corrections
  
  **7.5.4 Pantry Intelligence** (Future Enhancement - renamed from 7.5.3)
  - Low stock warnings
  - Expiration date tracking (optional)
  - Pantry analytics (most used ingredients)
  - Smart shopping suggestions based on pantry
  
  **Implementation Order:**
  1. Shopping ‚Üí Pantry Transfer with quantity adjustment üöß CURRENT
  2. Recipe Completion Tracking (more complex, needs UI decisions)  
  3. Pantry Intelligence (analytics, future enhancement)

### ‚¨ú Not Started:
- **7.1.2 Screenshot/Image OCR**
- **7.1.3 Manual Ingredient Library**
- **7.1.4 Recipe Import from PDF/Document**
- **7.1.5 Google Search Integration**
- **7.2 User Accounts & Authentication**
- **7.3 Dietary Preferences**
- **7.4.2 Advanced Unit Features** (user preferences, temperature, etc.)
- **7.6 Shopping List & Meal Plan Clear Functions** (NEW - Oct 20, 2025)
  - **Issue**: Shopping list and meal plan are synchronized - need proper clear functionality
  - **Design Decision Needed**: How to handle clearing when they're connected
  
  **Option A: Clear Shopping List Regenerates from Meal Plan**
  - Clear Shopping List button clears and immediately regenerates from current meal plan
  - Useful for "recalculating" if something got messed up
  - Keeps meal plan as source of truth
  
  **Option B: Separate the Generation (Snapshot Model)**
  - Shopping list becomes a "snapshot" when generated
  - Changes to meal plan don't auto-update shopping list
  - User must explicitly regenerate
  - More control but less synchronized
  
  **Option C: Both Clear Buttons in Appropriate Places**
  - "Clear Meal Plan" on the Meal Planner page (where it belongs)
  - "Clear & Regenerate List" on Shopping List page
  - Each page manages its own data
  - Most explicit but potentially more complex
  
  **To Decide Later During Refactor**:
  - Which model best fits user workflow?
  - Should lists be synchronized or snapshots?
  - Where should clear functions live?
- **7.5 Pantry Lifecycle Management** (NEW - Added Oct 20, 2025)
  
  **7.5.1 Shopping List ‚Üí Pantry Transfer**
  - Mark shopping list as "purchased/complete"
  - Auto-add all ingredients to pantry
  - Handle quantity additions for existing items
  - Show confirmation of transfer
  - Clear or archive completed shopping lists
  
  **7.5.2 Recipe Completion Tracking**
  - Mark recipes as "cooked/completed"
  - Deduct used ingredients from pantry
  - Track cooking history
  - Handle partial quantities
  - Prevent negative pantry quantities
  
  **Questions to Consider When Implementing:**
  - Where should "Mark as Cooked" button live? (meal planner calendar, recipe cards, or both?)
  - How to handle partial recipe cooking? (if someone makes half a recipe)
  - Should we track cooking history? (show "You made this 3 times", help with suggestions)
  - How to handle insufficient pantry quantities? (warning with override option?)
  
  **7.5.3 Pantry Intelligence** (Future Enhancement)
  - Low stock warnings
  - Expiration date tracking (optional)
  - Pantry analytics (most used ingredients)
  - Smart shopping suggestions based on pantry
  
  **Implementation Order:**
  1. Shopping ‚Üí Pantry Transfer (simpler, immediate value)
  2. Recipe Completion Tracking (more complex, needs UI decisions)  
  3. Pantry Intelligence (analytics, future enhancement)
